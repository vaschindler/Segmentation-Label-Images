# Segmentation-Label-Images
This repository enables you with jupyter notebook to great beautiful segmentation labels after your training!


After training Deep learning frameworks on semantic images and getting the prediction, this images need to be shown in a oranized way with labels. With this jupyter notebook you can arrange your groundtruth and prediction of semantic images with fitting labels, which are really inside the image. 

* The code will arrange your images, groundtruth, segmentation overlay and prediction.
* There will be placed the segmentation tags from the prediction image on the right side as labels.
* Written in python 3.6
